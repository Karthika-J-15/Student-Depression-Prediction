# 🎓 Student Depression Prediction 🎯

This project predicts the likelihood of depression in students based on various input features using **Logistic Regression**. The model was trained after performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, **feature standardization**, and **dimensionality reduction (PCA)**. The final solution is deployed using **Streamlit** for a simple and interactive user experience.

## 📊 Workflow Summary

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis  
   - Identification of key features affecting mental health

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Label encoding and feature engineering  
   - Standardization (StandardScaler)

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - Applied PCA to reduce feature space while preserving variance
